<a href="https://github.com/SMAPPNYU/smapp_how_to/blob/master/howto_request_a_collection.md">How to request a collection.</a>

##Templates

These are templates for making scripts so our scripts stay consistent across programmers. They basically just set up a file structure and basic required files so they aren't forgotten. Uniform and standard setup for command line args. They also import dependencies properly so we don't waste time with that. 

###mongo_query_scripts (for querying mongo or BSON file)
We currently have two templates for making scripts that take command line arguments for:
python
javascript

###twitter_query_scripts (for querying the twitter API)
We currently have one template for making scripts that query the twitter API.
